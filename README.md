# Underglow Lights for RC Car

This project contains the code from my "LED Lights for RC Car" YouTube videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL96jbsz35-llmwog3LWJorAzYf_Qm90JE

## Overview

### Underglow Lights for RC Car | Part 2

See YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARAg_Y2TWjk

This code uses a single push button with the internal pullup resistor in the arduino nano to switch between several effects.

This is the final finished code from this project. It uses two push buttons and a tilt switch. One push button cycles through patterns in each mode. The other push button cycles between modes. 

#### Mode 1
Tilt Switch Mode: Changes colors when tilt switch is jostled (when RC car drives over ramps or bumps).
#### Mode 2
Patterns Mode: Switches between different effects and patterns with the pattern select button.
#### Mode 3
Solid Colors Mode: Switches between solid colors with the pattern select button.
